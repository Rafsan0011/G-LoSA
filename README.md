# G-LoSA
G-LoSA (Graph-based Local Structure Alignment) is an efficient computational method to align protein local structures in a sequence order independent way and to provide the GA-score (between 0 and 1), a size-independent quantity of structural similarity for a given local structure pair. In particular, the GA-score is calculated based on the chemical features of each amino acid and can be applied to measure the structural similarity with the local structures of diverse sizes and characteristics, yet maintaining its length independency. In G-LoSA, both the iterative maximum clique search and the fragment superposition are adopted to generate all possible alignments between two different local structures and the optimal alignment is determined by the maximum GA-score.
